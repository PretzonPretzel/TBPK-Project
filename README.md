# TBPK-Project - Video Transcript RAG - Ollama & Qdrant
This project is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline which enables users to ask our local language model, using a vector similarity search via Qdrant, various questions relating to the CS370 course material. Our model will then return related video segments that will answer the question the user posed.
